## Notes
Pro Memorie: I marked a number of villages with the tag village (because there were names of villages besides it), but this sign is also used for (non-Roman Catholic) churches (these could be villages with Saint Thomas / Syrian Christian churches)

Question: when are a lot of trees a forest? Or a set of houses a village
Question (Femke): is it alright to call a symbol (i.e. a house, house with a tree etc.) a "village", since it adds subjective interpretation? 
Remark (Femke): Regarding last question, I'll opt for settlement (though that is also problematic).
Shipyard: multiple objects constitute the shipyard (anchor, ships, wood beams)

Question (Femke): what do we do with objects we do not recognise, but differ from other objects within the maps?

- Symbolical connotation
- beschrijven wat je ziet (bibliografisch beschrijven)
- beeldtaal binnen kaartenmakers 
- Ferwerda 
- Michiel van Groesen 
- topographical symbols 
- regels a priori vast stellen / of data-driven regels infereren 



## Questions

Question (Suze): would like to have the reference to 'kaart van de stad Bat'
