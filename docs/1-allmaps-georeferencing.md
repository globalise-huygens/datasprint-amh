# Georeferencing with Allmaps.org

Report of breakout session 1 during the GLOBALISE datasprint.

## Preparations

Jules Schoonman prepared a document with links to relevant materials: https://observablehq.com/@allmaps/globalise-datasprint. It contains an overview of the collection of maps that was selected for the datasprint. Selecting a map from this list loads a preview and provides a link to start georeferencing using the Allmaps.org tool.

After a short introduction to the Allmaps.org tool (and the IIIF standard it uses to load maps and save annotations) by Jules the group set about georeferencing maps.

## Results

- by the end of the session, the group had georeferenced 48 maps (to view the results click the link provided here: https://observablehq.com/@allmaps/globalise-datasprint#cell-515)
- the group critical discussion on usability of information on georeferenced maps
  - historical maps were obviously drawn for specific purposes (maps of coastlines are e.g. often very sketchy and are therefore difficult to georeference); if your aim is to extract information from georeferenced maps (see the report of session 2: https://github.com/globalise-huygens/datasprint-amh/blob/main/docs/2-object-recognition.md), it is important to keep in mind for what purpose the map was drawn and hence what information could be reliably extracted from it
  - some maps appear to have not been georeferenced correctly, but this has to do with projection (can be adjusted)
